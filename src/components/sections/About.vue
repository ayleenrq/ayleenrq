            An Informatics Engineering student from the Department of Information Technology at
            Malang State Polytechnic, expected to graduate in 2027. Interested in UI Visual Design
            and Frontend Development, with an interest in creating visually appealing and
            user-centered digital interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have completed an intensive bootcamp in UI-UX Research and Design, where I gained
            hands-on experience in user research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing.
            This experience has strengthened my understanding of user behavior and design thinking
            processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Motivated, detail-oriented, and always eager to learn, I continuously explore new tools
            and technologies to improve both my design and coding skills.
